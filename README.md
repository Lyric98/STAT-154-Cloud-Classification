# STAT-154-Cloud-Classification

How to reproduce this entire lab
==========================

1) Clone the github repository, maintaining the directory structure 
   git clone this repo

2) Place the image files into the path to where you cloned the repository 
   (like "/Users/liyanran/Desktop/19Spring/STAT154/project/project2/image_data")

3) To use the random split way to do training:
   Open "random.Rnw" and knit it.
   
4) To use the grid split way to do training:
   Open "grid.Rnw" and knit it.

5) To generate the plots in the Random Forests section:
   Open "random_forest.R"
   
6) To see our cross validation work or wanna using other classifiers:
   Open "CVgeneric.R".

7) All the image files should now be in "~/figures".  
   
8) The latex file should now compile.  Edit the analysis results as necessary.
