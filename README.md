   git clone this repo

2) Place the image files into the path to where you cloned the repository 
   (like "/Users/liyanran/Desktop/19Spring/STAT154/project/project2/image_data")
   
3ï¼‰To generate EDA figures:
   Open "EDA.R".

4) To use the random split way to do training:
   Open "random.Rnw" and knit it.
   
5) To use the grid split way to do training:
   Open "grid.Rnw" and knit it.

6) To generate the plots in the Random Forests section:
